## Code

The project contains two main files:

1. `index.html` - contains the structure of the web page and the rich text editor. It uses the Font Awesome library for icons and the Highlight.js library for syntax highlighting.

2. `script.js` - contains the JavaScript code that powers the functionality of the text editor. This script includes event listeners for all buttons and inputs, commands to modify the text in the editor, and local storage functionality to save and load the user's text.
