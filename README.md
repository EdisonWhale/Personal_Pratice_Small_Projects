# My Personal Small Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of various small projects that I've created based on my own quirky ideas, mainly for the purpose of practicing and improving my coding skills. The projects are primarily written in JavaScript and Python. However, I might add projects in Java and C++ in the future.

If you find any of these projects helpful or interesting, please consider giving this repository a star!
