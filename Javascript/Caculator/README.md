## Code

The project mainly consists of two files:

1. `index.html` - This contains the structure of the web page and the calculator. It utilizes the Font Awesome library for icons.

2. `script.js` - This contains the JavaScript code that enables the functionality of the calculator. The script encompasses event listeners for all buttons and inputs, modifies text in the display, saves and loads user's calculation history, and implements the switching of the dark mode.
